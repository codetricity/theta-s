== Video Conversion From Dual Fish-Eye to Equirectangular

Video is stored on the camera in dual fish-eye mode.

The official RICOH desktop app will convert this to equirectangular
mode. By default, the program will take your file name and add `_er` to it.
The file is saved in the same directory that the original video file was in.

Both the input and output are `.mp4` format videos.

The program will convert it to equirectangular. Note that there is
a minor color shading difference on the right side of the screen grab.
The camera has two lenses. Each lens captures and saves one sphere.
The software on the computer stitches the image together.

You can now load the video up to YouTube to your normal channel.  YouTube
will grab the meta data and add the 360 degree video controls automatically.
This is cool!
