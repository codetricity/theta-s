=== Other Hardware

Although you can run API commands over the USB cable, you can also use
cheap boards that can handle a WiFi signal. The cheapest boards are
based on the ESP8266, which sell for between $6 and $15. Most boards can
be purchased for $10 and come with the microcontroller, WiFi components,
and flash.
