== JavaScript

Normally, JavaScript within a web browser will not be able to access the
THETA due to security restrictions. However, Node.js is able to communicate
with the camera, so that’s what I recommend using.

In addition to server-side applications,
people have successfully built applications using Cordova and
Titanium. At the DeveloperWeek Hackathon, Thuong Ho showed a nice
example using
http://ionicframework.com/[Ionic]
and
http://browserify.org/[Browserify].
Browserify lets you require('modules') in the browser by bundling
up all of your dependencies. He used Ionic to get the
https://angularjs.org/[AngularJS] components in his mobile application and
was able to take a picture and download the code using the Node.js example code
below.

WARNING: Remember that running JavaScript in a browser directly will result in an error when you access the camera. You must use something like Node.js or another way of running the code.

Let's start with the easiest example, Node.js, from the command line.

I https://nodejs.org/en/[downloaded Node.js] for Windows.
Then, I followed a
blog post by Satoru Yamada who describes
http://theta360developers.github.io/blog/javascript/2015/12/17/theta-s-nodejs.html[how to
access the THETA camera with JavaScript].
After copying and pasting his code into a text editor,
titling the program `main.js` and running it using the
`node` command prompt” I ran into a problem with the `osc-client`.

This was simply remedied by downloading the
https://www.npmjs.com/package/osc-client[`osc-client`] using NPM.
After downloading `osc-client`, I tried running the program at
the command prompt again.

IMPORTANT: Remember to connect to the camera over WiFi first

  var fs = require('fs');
  var OscClientClass = require('osc-client').OscClient;

  var domain = '192.168.1.1';
  var port = '80';
  var client = new OscClientClass(domain, port);
  var sessionId;
  var filename;

  client.startSession().then(function(res){
    sessionId = res.body.results.sessionId;
    return client.takePicture(sessionId);
    })

  .then(function (res) {
    var pictureUri = res.body.results.fileUri;
    console.log('pictureUri :%s',pictureUri);

    var path = pictureUri.split('/');
    filename = path.pop();
    return client.getImage(pictureUri);
  })
  .then(function(res){
    var imgData = res.body;
    fs.writeFile(filename,imgData);
    return client.closeSession(sessionId);
  });

If everything goes well then the program will tell the camera to
take a picture, then save the newly created picture in the directory where
you executed the command. The file is immediately transferred to the computer.

If you want to take videos there is an additional package that needs to be
installed. A community member has created an add on to the osc-client
called https://www.npmjs.com/package/osc-client-theta_s[osc-client-theta_s]
that allows video capture and download. His code is included in the same link.

I ran into a series of problems with his code. First I had to download a
series of modules (superagent, debug, qs, osc-client-theta_s)
using NPM (which can be found by simply typing in the “find packages”
  search bar). Then `ThetaSOscClient` returned as undefined.

So far, I have not been able to move past this point.
The
https://gitlab.com/horihiro/osc-client-theta_s/tree/master[entire code sample for osc-client-theta_s is available on GitLab].

I saw a demo by Nate Levine at the DeveloperWeek Hackathon where he was
able to successfully take a video using the osc-client-theta_s module and
download it to his local computer. He mentioned that the example code
from horihori doesn't work. However, the module does work and his team
won the THETA API hackathon prize at the hackathon. They took 2nd place
overall out of 120 teams. I have a note out to have to try and get his
example code.
