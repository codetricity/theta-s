== Testing THETA S API with JavaScript

Normally, JavaScript within a web browser will not be able to access the
THETA due to security restrictions. However, Node.js is able to communicate
with the camera, so that’s what I recommend using.

I https://nodejs.org/en/[downloaded Node.js] for Windows.
Then, I followed a
blog post by Satoru Yamada who describes
http://theta360developers.github.io/blog/javascript/2015/12/17/theta-s-nodejs.html[how to
access the THETA camera with JavaScript].
After copying and pasting his code into a text editor,
titling the program `main.js` and running it using the
`node` command prompt” I ran into a problem with the `osc-client`.

This was simply remedied by downloading the
https://www.npmjs.com/package/osc-client[`osc-client`] using NPM.
After downloading osc-client, I tried running the program at
the command prompt again.

IMPORTANT: Remember to connect to the camera over WiFi first

If everything goes well then the program will tell the camera to
take a picture, then save the newly created picture in the directory where
you executed the command. The file is immediately transferred to the computer.

If you want to take videos there is an additional package that needs to be
installed. A community member has created an add on to the osc-client
called https://www.npmjs.com/package/osc-client-theta_s[osc-client-theta_s]
that allows video capture and download. His code is included in the same link.

I ran into a series of problems with his code. First I had to download a
series of modules (superagent, debug, qs, osc-client-theta_s)
using NPM (which can be found by simply typing in the “find packages”
  search bar). Then `ThetaSOscClient` returned as undefined.

So far, I have not been able to move past this point.

Perhaps you may have better luck.
